# Open World UE5

My first project developed with Unreal Engine 5 using C++ from scratch. 

Partially based on the course "Unreal Engine 5 C++ The Ultimate Game Developer Course" by Stephen Ulibarri.

So far it consists in an open world with a flying bird which can explore a desert. I plan to expand it in the future.
